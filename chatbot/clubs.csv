Furries at Berkeley,"The furry fandom is a subculture interested in anthropomorphic animals. Its origins date back to at least the 1980s in science fiction and comic conventions. Due to the diversity within the fandom, as well as fictional portrayals of the fandom based heavily on stereotypes, a certain amount of stigma and controversy is unfortunately associated with the fandom. The Anthropomorphic Animal Appreciation Association hopes to serve and portray the furry population on campus positively, as well as foster community collaboration between furries at Berkeley with other interest-based or academic groups."
AFX Dance,"AFX Dance is a dance group founded by Ping Quach, Geoffrey Chen, and Rosemary Hua in Fall 2011 to give dancers an opportunity to learn about and participate in dance culture, continuously build our community, and positively impact those around us through that process.
